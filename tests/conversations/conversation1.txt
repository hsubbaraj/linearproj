Product Manager: Hey team, I've been getting feedback from our users about the AI assistant, and there are a couple of areas we need to focus on.

Salesperson 1: Yeah, I've noticed that the assistant sometimes struggles to understand complex product queries. It would be great if it could handle more detailed questions about our products.

Engineer: That's a good point. We might need to enhance the natural language processing capabilities of the assistant to better understand and respond to complex queries.

Product Manager: Agreed. Also, another issue that came up is the integration with our CRM system. Some salespeople are finding it difficult to sync their customer data with the assistant.

Salesperson 2: Exactly, seamless integration with our CRM would really streamline our workflow. It's currently a bit clunky and requires manual updates.

Engineer: I see. Improving the CRM integration could involve developing a more robust API connection between our system and the assistant. I'll look into that.

Product Manager: Great, let's prioritize these two tasks for the next sprint. We'll focus on enhancing the natural language processing for complex queries and improving CRM integration.
