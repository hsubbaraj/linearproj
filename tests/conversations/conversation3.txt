Product Manager: Team, we've gathered some valuable insights from user feedback about our virtual meeting platform. There are key enhancements we need to tackle to improve our service.

Customer Support Lead: I've been hearing that users are experiencing audio quality issues during large meetings. Enhancing the audio processing to reduce background noise and echo could greatly improve their experience.

Developer: That's a valid concern. We could implement advanced audio filtering algorithms and possibly integrate machine learning models to dynamically adjust for varying audio environments. It'll enhance clarity and reduce distractions.

Product Manager: Excellent point. Another feedback point is about the difficulty in scheduling across different time zones within our platform. Users find it confusing and often end up missing meetings.

Project Coordinator: Yes, a more intuitive time zone management feature would be beneficial. Maybe something that automatically adjusts meeting times for participants in different time zones and clearly displays local times.

Developer: Addressing the time zone challenge could mean developing a smarter scheduling system that integrates with external calendars and uses geolocation to suggest meeting times. It sounds like a significant UX improvement.

Product Manager: Fantastic. Let's focus on these two areas for our next development cycle: refining the audio processing for better quality in large meetings and creating a more user-friendly scheduling system that handles time zones intelligently.
